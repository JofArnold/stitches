# [Stitches With Stylus and Retina Support](https://github.com/JofArnold/stitches)

This app adds a few features to the very great Stitches 1.3.5. Stitches is an HTML5 sprite sheet generator. Original documentation - from which this version doesn't stray significantly - is available
[here](http://draeton.github.com/stitches/stitches/doc/stitches.js.html).

## Warning

This is provided as-is. There's no tests. The code is hacked-together from Stitches 1.3.5 with no regard for other people using it. Having said that, it works well if you wish to create stylus-compatible retina and non-retina spritemaps and stylesheets.
